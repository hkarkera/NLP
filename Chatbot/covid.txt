COVID-19 is an illness caused by a virus that can spread from person to person.

COVID-19 spreads from person to person when you come in close contact (about 6 feet or twoarm lengths) with a person who has COVID-19. You can become infected from respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. You may also be able to get it by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then by touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.

The incubation period (amount of time between exposure to the virus and development of symptoms of COVID-19) ranges from 1-14 days. It is most commonly 5-6 days, and in some rare cases has been reported to be longer than 14 days.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, fatigue and myalgia (achy muscles). Other less common symptoms include runny nose, headache, sore throat, abdominal pain and diarrhea. 

The most vulnerable population for this particular virus is those of older age, and also those who have serious chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes.  

There are several ways you can protect yourself from the virus. The best way to prevent acquiring this virus is avoid contact with someone who has it. Thatâ€™s where social distancing and hand hygiene come into play.

Social distancing measures restrict when and where people can gather in order to stop or slow the spread of infectious diseases.  

If you test positive for covid-19, you should stay home to avoid infecting others, and you should contact your healthcare provider for advice.
